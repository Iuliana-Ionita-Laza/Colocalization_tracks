    <h2>Co-localization segments of human genome for Roadmap cell types</h2>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      A co-localization statistic is to identify individual (tissue/cell type specific) regulatory regions that are under sequence constraint. 
      We employ a sliding-window type approach with window size 1 Kb, and 500 bps overlap, and for each such window we report a co-localization local fdr value. 
      The <a target="_blank" href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&hubUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Iuliana-Ionita-Laza/Colocalization_tracks/master/hub.txt">UCSC Genome Browser Track Hub</a> is provided to view the co-localized regulatory segments in the human genome assembly hg19 for 127 Roadmap cell types. 
      There is an <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am6FxqAtrFDwdHU1UC13ZUxKYy1XVEJPUzV6MEtQOXc&usp=sharing">online spreadsheet</a> with information about the 127 Roadmap cell types. 
      The track displays co-localized regions which have local fdr < 0.3 in black segments.
